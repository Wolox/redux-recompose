## withPreFetch	

 The `withPreFetch` injector allows to inject behaviour before the service call. This injector is not thought for normalizing/denormalizing data. If this is the intention, 	
use you normalizing/denormalizing function on the `payload` property as shown below:	

 Example:	

 ```js	
  import { withPreFetch } from 'redux-recompose';	
   const actionCreators = {	
    someAction: data => ({	
      type: actionType,	
      target: someTarget,	
      service: someService,	
      payload: denormalize(data),	
      injections: [	
        withPreFetch(dispatch => {	
            /* you can dispatch other actions before the service call */	
        })	
      ]	
    })	
  };	
```
