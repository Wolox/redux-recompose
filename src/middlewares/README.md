## fetchMiddleware

This middleware allows us to integrate custom middlewares into
`redux-recompose` actions and reducers.
It works with Redux's `applyMiddleware` nicely, since it is simply passed down as a regular middleware

Usage example:

```js
import { fetchMiddleware } from 'redux-recompose';

const store = createStore(
  reducers, applyMiddleware(fetchMiddleware))
);
```

Then, in your `action.js`, the logic for the code you want your middleware to execute can be added like this:

```js
const someActions = {
  actionWithMiddleware: () => {
    /*
     * some more code
     */
    return {
      type: actionType.ACTION_TYPE,
      target: 'some_target',
      service: someServiceFunction
      payload: serviceFunctionPayload,
      successSelector: (response) => { /* some return value */ },
      failureSelector: (response) => { /* some return value */ }
    }
  }
}
```

where:

`type` is the action type dispatched.
`target` is the target string.
`service` is the service function called by the middleware (`get`, `post`, `put`, etc)
`payload` is the parameter to pass down to the `service`. If more than one argument is required, use an object in a key/value form. Ex: `payload: {someParam: someParamValue, otherParam: otherParamalue}`
`successSelector` is the function to be executed after a successful service call, recieves the response from the `service`. This can be used to format the response from the api call before a state change e.g. `(response) => response.data`
`failureSelector` is the function to be executed after a failed service call, recieves the response from the `service`. Typically used for getting server error messages to display e.g. `(response) => response.error`
